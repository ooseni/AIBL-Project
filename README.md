## Project Details
The data is heterogenous, in relation to Alzheimer’s disease (AD), which is the most common type of dementia. It has been reported that COVID-19 steeply worsened the neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia. Making use of the power of AI/ML to benefit healthcare across the board is significant, and dementia is no exception,especially during these extreme circumstances. The data (http://adni.loni.usc.edu/data-samples/access-data/), which has been approved by the AIBL Management Committee for the purpose of teaching, can be accessed in the BBL Assessment area. The data description can be found by using the Data Dictionary search box in http://adni.loni.usc.edu/data-dictionary-search/. The AIBL data were categorised into three clinical diagnostic results: Healthy Control (HC), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). This coursework will consider two categories, i.e. HC and NonHC (combining MCI and AD).


## The Datasets
The data is heterogenous. Eight different datasets were provided in relation to
Alzheimer's disease (AD), and there exists a primary key which can be used to
combine the datasets into a single csv file. More detailed info about the datasets
is provided in the AIBL_outline.docx.

- The **apoeres_data** contain the information about the **Genotype**
- The **cdr_data** contain the information about the **CDR score Cognitive assessment**
- The **lab_data** contain the information about the **Blood test**
- The **med_hist** contain the information about the **Medical history**
- The **mmse_data** contain the information about the **MMSE score score Cognitive assessment**
- The **neurobat** contain the information about the **Logical memory recall score Cognitive assessment**
- The **pdxconv** contain the information about the **Clinical diagnosis**
- The **ptdemog** contain the information about the **Gender and DoB**


## ML-Zip
This folder contains all the files for the project in an archived form.


## Final Submission
This folder contains two files, one which contains the final notebook file, and
the other which is the presentation file in pdf format.


##  AIBL project overview
Your developed project must demonstrate your learning to date and your knowledge of
machine learning (ML) and data modelling, to include the use of at least 3 supervised and/or unsupervised learning algorithms, based on the Australian Imaging Biomarkers and Lifestyle flagship study of ageing (AIBL) data.
