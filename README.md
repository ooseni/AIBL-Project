## Project Details
The data is heterogenous, in relation to Alzheimer’s disease (AD), which is the most common type of dementia. It has been reported that COVID-19 steeply worsened the neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia. Making use of the power of AI/ML to benefit healthcare across the board is significant, and dementia is no exception,especially during these extreme circumstances. The data (http://adni.loni.usc.edu/data-samples/access-data/), which has been approved by the AIBL Management Committee for the purpose of teaching, can be accessed in the BBL Assessment area. The data description can be found by using the Data Dictionary search box in http://adni.loni.usc.edu/data-dictionary-search/. The AIBL data were categorised into three clinical diagnostic results: Healthy Control (HC), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). This coursework will consider two categories, i.e. HC and NonHC (combining MCI and AD).


## The Datasets
The data is heterogenous. Eight different datasets were provided in relation to
Alzheimer's disease (AD), and there exists a primary key which can be used to
combine the datasets into a single csv file. More detailed info about the datasets
is provided in the AIBL_outline.docx
